It’s a web app built with SvelteKit, Zero-cache, and a PostgreSQL database hosted on Fly.io. The backend runs in Docker containers, and the app works both online and offline using Index.db and .\nWhen used on mobile, Budget can be saved to the home screen and accessed like a native app. Offline changes are stored locally and synced automatically when back online, with Zero-cache handling the data synchronization.\nIn this post, I’ll go over why I built Budget, the technologies behind it, and how it all comes together.\nEnvelope Budgeting # Envelope budgeting is a method of managing finances by allocating money into specific categories—traditionally using physical envelopes. Each envelope represents a spending category, such as groceries, rent, or entertainment, and you only spend what’s in each envelope. When an envelope is empty, you either stop spending in that category or adjust by moving money from another envelope.\nThis approach helps create discipline around spending by making budgets more tangible. Even in digital form, the envelope method remains useful for controlling expenses and ensuring money is allocated purposefully. Many modern budgeting apps replicate this system, allowing users to track their categories virtually instead of using physical cash.\nBudget follows a similar principle by allowing users to categorize their spending and track their finances in a structured way. With offline support and automatic syncing, it provides a local-first alternative to traditional envelope budgeting apps.\nData Flow in Budget # Budget follows a local-first architecture, meaning data is first stored on the user’s device and later synced with the backend when an internet connection is available. Here\u0026rsquo;s how data flows through the system:\nUser Interaction (Frontend - SvelteKit)\nA user enters a transaction, updates a budget category, or modifies financial data through the SvelteKit frontend.\nThese actions are handled locally first to ensure responsiveness and offline support.\nLocal Storage \u0026amp; Caching (Zero-Cache \u0026amp; IndexedDB)\nZero-cache intercepts all changes and saves them to the user’s IndexedDB (a built-in browser database).\nThis ensures that even if the user is offline, their data remains available and can be accessed instantly.\nBackground Syncing (Zero-Cache Directly to PostgreSQL on Fly.io)\nWhen an internet connection is detected, Zero-cache automatically syncs the locally stored changes directly to PostgreSQL on Fly.io.\nZero-cache ensures data consistency, handling any conflicts or merge issues.\nRetrieving Data (Syncing Updates Back to the User)\nWhen the user accesses the app while online, Zero-cache pulls the latest updates from PostgreSQL and keeps IndexedDB up to date.\nThis ensures that the user always has the most recent data stored locally for offline access.\n","date":"10112-04-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/budgetapp/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Intro to Obsidian and Hugo","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10112-04-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/local/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Local","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10112-04-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10112-04-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/project/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Project","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"10112-04-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/svelte/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Svelte","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10112-04-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10112-04-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/typescript/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Typescript","type":"tags"},{"content":" Intro to Obsidian and Hugo # I am testing this again # A third time # ","date":"313112-03-317","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/testingpost/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Intro to Obsidian and Hugo","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/full-stack-project/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"[Full-Stack, Project]","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
